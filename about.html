        <p class="story-text">
          This shop began with a simple idea: to create a place where people can slow down,
          enjoy great coffee, and feel a genuine sense of connection. coffee, for me, has always
          been more than just a drink it's a daily ritual that brings comfort and
          brings people closer.
          that's the heart behind everything we do here.

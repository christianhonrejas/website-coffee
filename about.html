      <h1>About us</h1>
      <p class="story-text">
          Welcome to our shop! My name is <span class="name">Christian Honrejas, </span>
          and I'm proud to be the owner of this space where passion for coffee and community come together.
        </p>
        <p class="story-text">
          This shop began with a simple idea: to create a place where people can slow down,
          enjoy great coffee, and feel a genuine sense of connection. coffee, for me, has always
          been more than just a drink it's a daily ritual that brings comfort and
          brings people closer.
          that's the heart behind everything we do here.

        Every cup we prepare is a reflection of the passion and dediction we put into our craft.
        What makes us different is not just the flavor of our coffee, but the atmosphere we create
        friendly, welcoming, and personal.
